              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Do any of these look familiar? Can you also remember when these
              critical voices were the loudest? Are there any situations that
              seem to trigger them? <br /><br/>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a founder/ entrepreneur/ CXO, there are certain scenarios that
              could bring on the Imposter Syndrome most often. Please see if any
              of these seem to resonate with you:
              <br /><br/>
              <div style={{padding: "0 2%"}}>
              ⇒ <b>Starting A New Role/Venture:</b> Stepping out of the comfort zone
              may lead to feeling inadequate, undermining one's unique strengths
              and abilities. <br />⇒ <b>Presenting/ Pitching/ Networking/ Team
              Leading:</b> These situations require maintaining a confident,
              knowledgeable, and attractive self-image, causing stress for many.{" "}
              <br />⇒ <b>Compliments/Rewards In Front Of Peers:</b> Achievements may
              trigger Imposter Syndrome as individuals compare themselves to
              others and downplay their own accomplishments, attributing them to
              luck.
              <br />⇒ <b>Ambitious Goals Set By High Achievers:</b> High achievers
              often set challenging goals, pushing themselves into uncertain and
              unfamiliar territory, where self-doubts naturally surface.
              <br />⇒ <b>Building A Public Image:</b> Setting and meeting high
              standards for yourself and others can lead to doubts about
              genuineness, likeability, skills, or accomplishments.
